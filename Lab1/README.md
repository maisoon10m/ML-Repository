Hello, my name is Maisoon Mohammed Alabdullah.

I am currently a third-year student in the College of Computer Science and Information Technology, specializing in Computer Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. My studies concentrate on understanding both the theoretical and practical aspects of modern computing and intelligent systems.

I have a strong interest in Machine Learning, particularly in how algorithms can learn from data to support decision-making and automation in real-world applications. I am eager to further develop my skills in this field throughout this course.
