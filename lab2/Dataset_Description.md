# Mobile Phone Price Classification
This is a supervised multiclass classification problem where the goal is to predict the price category of a mobile phone based on its technical specifications. The dataset includes features such as battery power, RAM, internal memory, screen size, and connectivity options. The target variable is price_range, which represents four price levels: low, medium, high, and very high. The model is expected to learn the relationship between mobile phone features and their corresponding price category in order to accurately classify new, unseen mobile phones.
